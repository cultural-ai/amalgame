Step 1. Start amalgame. 
OPM information asserted: None.
Other remarks: exact GIT versions of amalgame, ClioPatria and SWI-Prolog will be availble in future steps.

Step 2. Load source and target vocabularies, resp Wordnet 3.0 and Wordnet 2.0
OPM information asserted: None.
Other remarks: GIT versions of vocs will be available in future steps.

Step 3a. Partition WN 3.0 on the rdf:type of its skos:Concepts (gives a partioning on part of speech: verbs, nouns, adverbs, etc)
OPM information asserted: 
The partitioning is recorded as a time-stamped opmv:Process, 
along with the necessary triples to assert the input/output opmv:Artifiacts involved.
In addition, the login user and amalgame software (with full versioning info mentioned above) are asserted as opmv:Agents.
Other remarks: The URI to invoke the web service is also recorded.  This info should be sufficient to reproduce the partitioning later.

Step 3b: idem as 3a, but then for WN 2.0.

Step 4. Align WN 3.0 Adverbs to WN 2.0 Adverbs by case-insensitive skos:altLabel matching (gives most potential matches, but also many wrong homonym matches).
OPM information asserted: 
The label match is recorded as a time-stamped opmv:Process, 
along with the necessary triples to assert the input/output opmv:Artifiacts involved.
In addition, the login user and amalgame software (with full versioning info mentioned above) are asserted as opmv:Agents.
Other remarks: The URI to invoke the web service is also recorded.  This info should be sufficient to reproduce the label match later.
Resulting named graph (alignments in EDOAL format, with additional OPMV triples): http://semanticweb.cs.vu.nl/lod/wn30/edoal/exactlabel/adverb.ttl

Step 5. Align WN 3.0 Adverbs to WN 2.0 Adverbs by case-insensitive skos:definition matching (gives mostly correct matches, only one gloss appears on two adverbs).
OPM information asserted: 
The label match is recorded as a time-stamped opmv:Process, 
along with the necessary triples to assert the input/output opmv:Artifiacts involved.
In addition, the login user and amalgame software (with full versioning info mentioned above) are asserted as opmv:Agents.
Other remarks: The URI to invoke the web service is also recorded.  This info should be sufficient to reproduce the definition match later.
Resulting named graph (alignments in EDOAL format, with additional OPMV triples): http://semanticweb.cs.vu.nl/lod/wn30/edoal/glossmatch/adverb.ttl

Step 6. Calculate intersection of results of 4) and 5) (resolves ambiguity of the double gloss case)
OPM information asserted: 
The intersection (overlap) is recorded as a time-stamped opmv:Process, 
along with the necessary triples to assert the input/output opmv:Artifiacts involved.
In addition, the login user and amalgame software (with full versioning info mentioned above) are asserted as opmv:Agents.
Other remarks: The URI to invoke the web service is also recorded.  This info should be sufficient to reproduce the intersection later.
Resulting named graph (alignments in EDOAL format, with additional OPMV triples): http://semanticweb.cs.vu.nl/lod/wn30/edoal/glossmatch/adverb_label.ttl
Note that for each alignment cell the exact match information of the label and the gloss is still available.
This maps 98.62% or 3570 of all Wordnet 3.0 3620 Adverbs, leaving 50 unmapped.

Calculating trust based on only provenance info:
I see various obvious ways of calculating trust ratings.  
- One very generic, giving the results of 6 a higher rating simply because there is evidence for these mappings from two algorithms.
- Adding a little bit more domain info could lead to rating 5 higher that 4 because we know that homonyms are a more frequent source of errors than glosses that occur on multiple concepts.
- Adding even more domain info would combine the knowledge that WN 2.0 and 3.0  are two versions of the same dataset, that the partitioning avoids part of speech mix ups and that this, combined with exact label and exact gloss match gives most likely 100% precision.

A second obvious way would to extend the provenance info with information about human evaluations of samples of specific subsets (future work).

Davide, is this data you can work with? (Willem thinks so :-)

Feel free to ask questions if you have any,
