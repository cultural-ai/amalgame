Objective
Amalgame provides a web-based interactive platform for creating, analyzing and evaluating vocabulary alignments.  It aims to support domain experts to make alignments interactively.  To realize this it focuses on simple alignment techniques which the user understand and knows how to use, and which are sufficiently fast to be used in an interactive session.  Amalgame keeps track of all the provenance related information, so that mapping experiments can be replicated later, and other users can explore the context that played a role in creating the mappings.  Amalgame is implemented by using common web technology on the client (e.g. HTML,CSS,AJAX and the YUI toolkit) and SWI-Prolog's ClioPatria platform on the server.

Amalgame-specific Terminology:

Correspondence 
We define a correspondence as a relationship between two concepts.  In amalgame, the key associated data-structure is the align/3 term, that encodes a series of claims (3rd argument) about the relationship between a source (1st argument) and target concept (2nd argument).  The claims can be objective observations (such as the observation that the prefLabels of both concepts are the same) or interpretations (such as the claim that both concepts refer to the same entity or that one has a skos:broadMatch relationship to the other). Note that align/3 always denotes a 1-1 relationship, you need multiple align/3 terms to represent N-M relationships.
In OPM terms, a correspondence is too fine grained to play a direct role in an OPM graph.  However, each correspondence is part of a mapping dataset, which is an OPM Artifact with associated provenance information.  For each claim about two concepts, the align/3 term may record the evidence that was used to make or support that claim.

Mapping
We define a mapping as a homogeneous set of correspondences. These are homogeneous in that they make similar type of claims about their source and target concept.  Because of its homogeneous nature, we hope that evaluating only a small random subset will give reliable insights into the quality of the entire mapping. In amalgame mappings are typically represented as a list of align/3 terms.  This list can be materialized as EDOAL triples in a single named graph.
In OPM terms such a named graph is a single artifact, and all correspondences it contains have the same provenance, e.g. they have all been generated by the same sequence of processing steps.  

Alignment
An alignment in amalgame is a (typically) hetereogeneous set of correspondences between two vocabularies.  Typically, an alignment is made by merging all mappings of sufficient quality into a single data set.

Alignment strategy
An alignment strategy is a recipee that defines how the mappings that constitute the alignment have to be made.  It defines for all mappings the amalgame alignment modules that can create them, and their inputs.  In addition to the mappings actually used in the final alignment (these mappings are typically marked with amalgame:status amalgame:final) strategies typically also define (amalgame:intermediate) mappings that are used as input for processes generating other mappings and mappings that are explicitly not used (e.g. for lack of quality) and have been marked with amalgame:discarded.
A strategy defines a striped dependency graph between mappings (which are subclasses of opmv:Artifacts) and amalgame modules (which are subclasses of opmv:Processes).  

Provenance graph
The dependency graph of the alignment strategy can be seen as the backbone of an OPM provenance graph.  By executing such a strategy and recording the information that is specific to that execution, one can extend this backbone into a complete OPM graph.  Vice versa, if the OPM graph recording such an execution has been extended by amalgame's strategy vocabulary, the dependency graph that forms the backbone of the OPM graph can be re-used as an amalgame alignment strategy for another run.
